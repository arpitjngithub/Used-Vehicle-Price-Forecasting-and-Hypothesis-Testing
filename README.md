# Used-Vehicle-Price-Forecasting-Model-and-Hypothesis-Testing


**Guide:** Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran  
**Department:** Aerospace Engineering , IIT Bombay</br>
**Course:** AE 248  
**Project:** Course Project

## Overview

In this project, we developed a robust used vehicle price forecasting model using linear regression. The model effectively captures approximately 89% of the data variation, demonstrating its accuracy and reliability in predicting vehicle prices.

## Key Features

- **Data Handling**: Conducted extensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis to ensure the accuracy of the price predictions.
- **Model Performance**: Achieved high accuracy with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.1 lakhs and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 13%.

## Details

The project involved:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressing missing values, outliers, and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Preprocessing**: Transforming and normalizing data to improve model performance.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing data patterns and relationships to inform feature selection and model design.
4. **Model Development**: Implementing a linear regression model to forecast used vehicle prices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using MAE and MAPE to ensure prediction accuracy.

Feel free to explore the project repository to understand the methodologies and techniques used in developing the forecasting model.</br>
